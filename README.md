## Overview

The year is 2912, where space travel has become normal. The ship Titanic has hit a space-time anomaly (sounds familiar 🤔 ) and some of the passengers have been transported to an alternate dimension. Now we have the data from the first incident and we want to predict if this incident happens again who will be transported through the space-time anomaly.
