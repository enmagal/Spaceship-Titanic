## Business Understanding

The year is 2912, where space travel has become normal. The ship Titanic has hit a space-time anomaly (sounds familiar ü§î ) and some of the passengers have been transported to an alternate dimension. Now we have the data from the first incident and we want to predict if this incident happens again who will be transported through the space-time anomaly.

## Data Understanding

### Feature descriptions :

- **PassengerId** - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group.People in a group are often family members, but not always.

- **HomePlanet** - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.

- **CryoSleep** - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.

- **Cabin** - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.

- **Destination** - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.

- **Age** - The age of the passenger.

- **VIP** - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.

- **RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck** - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.

- **Name** - The first and last names of the passenger.

- **Transported** - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.

### EDA results

**Age distribution**
- 0-18 year olds were more likely to be transported than not.
- 18-25 year olds were less likely to be transported than not.
- Over 25 year olds were about equally likely to be transported than not.
